# nim-webview
Nim wrapper for Zaitsev's new [Webview](https://github.com/webview/webview).

The purpose of this repo is to support the new version of the webview and replace: https://github.com/oskca/webview

## Example

To get an idea of how simple it to use, have a look at our *test.nim*:


```nim
import webview

var wt = newWebview("TEST", "data:text/html, <h1>It worked! Yay!</h1>")
wt.show()
```

## Building

To build all you have to do is:

```bash
nim c test.nim
```

> ðŸ’¡ **For Windows:** (aka the elephant in the room) if you're building with MinGW, it would be a better idea to build with `nim c -d:WEBVIEW_NOEDGE test.nim` (but this means that you will be left without all the fancy additions of the newer, Edge-powered version of the Webview library). If you have VCC installed and feel adventurous enough, go with `nim c --cc:vcc test.nim` and pray that it'll work. If you want to have a look how I've managed to make it compile on Windows, have a look at the CI workflow here: https://github.com/drkameleon/nim-webview/blob/main/.github/workflows/windows.yml#L42-L65)
